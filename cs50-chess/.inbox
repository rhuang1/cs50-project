Hello,

Congratulations!  Your brand new HCS group account has been created as
"cs50-chess".  We are using "ssh" access; to use the account,
simply type ssh cs50-chess@hcs.harvard.edu from the prompt on any
fas.harvard.edu server.

The following FAS users have ssh access to the account:
 + oliverkim@fas.harvard.edu
 + rogerhuang@fas.harvard.edu

The following email addresses have access to the account through Harvard
PIN authentication:
 + oliverkim@college.harvard.edu
 + oliverkim@fas.harvard.edu
 + rogerhuang@college.harvard.edu
 + rogerhuang@fas.harvard.edu

If you have PIN access, you can view email for your account by visiting
https://mail.hcs.harvard.edu/ and pressing the PIN System login button.

To give other people access to the account or to stop their access to
the account, simply log into your account and type "access" at the
prompt, and follow the instructions (you'll probably want option E).

The newly created account has been emailed two introductory documents;
one desribes account policies and such, and the other describes how to
use your account to serve Web pages.  If you requested a mySQL database,
a third email containing your username, database name, and password has
also been sent to your account.  We'd also like to point your
attention to the Account Services FAQ at http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/faq
and our introductory tutorials at http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/tutorials.
In particular, see the tutorials for information on checking your
account's e-mail.

If you ever have any questions, comments, or problems regarding any of
our services, feel free to contact the HCS Account Services team at
acctserv@hcs.harvard.edu.  They'll be happy to assist you and/or make
suggestions on how your group can take full advantage of the services
we offer.

Thank you for using HCS!

Your HCS Web Site
----------------

With your HCS account comes a web site.  We support a variety of
languages and database-driven apps: PHP, Wordpress, and Ruby on Rails,
just to name a few.  If you want to keep it simple, your static HTML
site is welcome as well.

Your site's URL, which you might tell to people interested in your
group, is
     http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/cs50-chess

On your fas.harvard.edu account, you publish your website by putting
it in a directory called `public_html'; on HCS, we call this directory
`web'.  To create such a directory, type "mkdir web" at the prompt.

Once you've created the web directory, you may want to populate it
with some web pages. You can upload files to hcs using sftp, in the
same way that you upload files to FAS (for Windows users this means
using SecureFX or WinSCP, for Mac users probably Cyberduck). First, 
however, because HCS accounts do not have passwords you'll need
to create a temporary one.

To do this, connect to your hcs account and type the command "sftppasswd."
You'll be prompted for a password, which you should use to connect through
sftp. At 4AM every morning, these sftp passwords are reset.

The details for connecting to the account through sftp are:

hostname: hcs.harvard.edu
username: cs50-chess
password: the password you just set

Finally, you'll need to make sure the permissions on the files for your
site are correct.  We have a script set up to make this easy - 
just type "fixwebfiles" at the prompt.

We're happy to provide basic help getting started: simply send your
questions to acctserv@hcs.harvard.edu, or stop by our office hours
(schedule at http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/events). You can also read our
tutorials at www.hcs.harvard.edu/tutorials.

Best of luck with your new web site!

HCS Account Information
-----------------------

Hello! We have reset your mysql database password. Your new password is:
r4ZFgwenKwaR

This document contains some basic information about how to use this
service.  If you have any questions at all, don't hesitate to contact
us at <help@hcs.harvard.edu> or to stop by our office hours. Our office
hours schedule is available at <http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/events>.

First, HCS runs a useful tool called phpMyAdmin at
https://www.hcs.harvard.edu/phpmyadmin/. You can view and modify many
of your database settings here, and you can see which databases your
account currently has access to. If you would like a new database,
just send us an email at <help@hcs.harvard.edu>.

You can also access your MySQL database from the command line by
typing mysql -h mysql -u cs50-chess -p at the command
prompt. At the enter password prompt, type in your password:
r4ZFgwenKwaR

Some settings you would use in connecting to the database in a php script:
DBUSER = cs50-chess
DBPASS = r4ZFgwenKwaR
DBSERVER = mysql.hcs.harvard.edu

Again, if you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to
contact us.
